## Implementation

### Technologies
You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

**HTML**  
- Your HTML should be semantic.

**CSS**  
- Your game should be stylish.

**JavaScript & jQuery**  
- Your game should be playable *and* responsive.

## Expectations

### You

As a student you should be doing the following things:

- **Wireframes**
  Create wireframes in advance for your application to prevent surprises as you develop it.

- **Version Control**  
  Use **git** and **github** for version control, and make frequent incremental commits to prevent large scale implosions.

- **Hosting**  
  Host your application on **githubpages**, or something similar so the class and instructors can use it.  (We will review this!)

### Us

Since your instructors will be assessing your work, they will look for the following things:

- **Project Workflow**  
Did you complete the user stories, wireframes? Did you use source control as expected?

- **Technical Requirements**  
Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Responsive**  
The game should be playable on any device (desktop, tablet, phone, etc) without significant (if any) penalty in usability and user experience to the player.

- **Creativity**  
Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

- **Code Quality**  
Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?  Code is Communication!

- **Problem Solving**  
Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

## Deliverables

By the time the project is over, we will expect the following from you:

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app** (at least one)
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the **user stories you created**
