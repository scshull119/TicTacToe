### The game

[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a two-player adventure of mystery, mayhem, and intrigue.  It's probably a thing in your universe, but feel free to read up on it if you have to.

## Project Details

### Necessary features
A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. An interactive board which renders on page load
2. A way for players to set their name
3. A way for players to mark an empty space on their turn
4. The game should end when there is a winner, or if the game is a tie
5. The game should report the end state


###  Advanced features
Going above and beyond the basic implementation is desirable, should you have the time.  Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. A button on `game over` to reset the game back to initial state
2. A way to keep track of Player 1 vs. Player 2 wins
- An option to play vs. a computer with AI
  - Level 1: Random empty space is good enough
  - Level 2: Computer chooses a space which immediately blocks a player win
  - Level 3: Computer plays to win!
3. Make it possible to play 4x4, or 5x5 tic-tac-toe.  The logic you use to figure out a winner might change from the 3x3 version, to prevent too much repetition.
