##TicTacToe

###User Stories

- As a user, I would like to be able to enter my name and the name of my opponent, and see that information displayed onscreen, so that I can keep track of when it is my turn and which symbol I am.

- As a user, I would like to be able to choose whether I go first or second, and what symbol I am going to be, so that there is variety of gameplay and I don't have to give up my lucky symbol.  Maybe even something other than X and O.

- As a user, I would like to be able to play "best of five" with alternation of who goes first, so that the game won't end in under a minute.

- As a user, I would like to be able to play against the computer, in case none of my friends are around (but I do have friends.  I do.  I swear!)

- As a computer, I would like to be given sufficient AI logic to win sometimes, so that I don't have to spend eternity feeling inferior to humans.

- As user, I would like to be able to choose a square during my turn by clicking on it, so that I don't have to play the game by typing in the Javascript console, which I don't know how to use.

- As a computer, I would like a countdown timer to challenge the human user to choose a square quickly when it is their turn.
